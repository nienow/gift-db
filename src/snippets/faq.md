# Where did this data come from?

The data was compiled from successful projects on Kickstarter where the product is now for sale. We plan to add more data sources in the future.

# Are the products sorted by anything like popularity?

No. The products are sorted randomly. This is to prevent biasing the results. We want to give all products a fair chance to be discovered.

# Why isn't there filtering, sorting or searching controls?

The point of this site is to randomly discover new products. We don't want to bias the results by allowing you to filter, sort or search.

# Why don't some of the links work?

Some product websites have been taken down over the years. There is too much data to manually check every link. If you find a broken link, please click the "report" button on the product.

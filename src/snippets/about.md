# About

I initially created this site for myself, to help me find gift ideas that were unique. I was tired of seeing the same stuff being promoted by Amazon that everyone else is buying and wanted to find something new.

# The Data

The data was compiled from successful projects on Kickstarter that have external links to where the product is now for sale.

Certain categories were excluded from the data set. Categories that contained mostly digital assets (like video games) and categories that contained mostly services (like a business) were excluded.

# Reporting products that are not purchasable

Some product websites have been taken down over the years, so you will encounter broken links now and then.

Some products are just not purchasable, like an event, or a service.

If you find any problems, please click the "report" button on the product.
